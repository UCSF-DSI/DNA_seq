#### *Objective 2. Select variants in genes of interest*


<br/>
First of all, we need the built-in `org.Hs.eg.db` data from the `AnnotationDbi` package. `org.Hs.eg.db` contains human gene annotations as we can see by looking at the column names of this data.   
```{r message=FALSE}
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
org.Hs.eg.db

?org.Hs.eg.db
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

<br/>
Let's use the `select()` function to select genes in the TRP family on chr17, since our VCF file contains chr17 variants.  

Note: TRP = transient receptor potential. These genes are involved in temperature sensation and other processes (e.g. TRPV1 encodes a receptor for capsiacin).
```{r}
trp_ids <- select(org.Hs.eg.db, 
    keys=c("TRPV1", "TRPV2", "TRPV3"), 
    keytype="SYMBOL", 
    columns="ENTREZID")
trp_ids
```
